 /** A grammar-based tokenizer constructed with JFlex
  *
  * <p> This should be a good tokenizer for most European-language documents:
  *
  * <ul>
  *   <li>Splits words at punctuation characters, removing punctuation. However, a 
  *     dot that's not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token.
  *   <li>Splits words at hyphens, unless there's a number in the token, in which case
  *     the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split.
  *   <li>Recognizes email addresses and internet hostnames as one token.
  * </ul>
  *
  * <p>Many applications have specific tokenizer needs.  If this tokenizer does
  * not suit your application, please consider copying this source code
  * directory to your project and maintaining your own grammar-based tokenizer.
