 /**
  * Computes on-line estimates of mean, variance and all five quartiles (notably including the
  * median).  Since this is done in a completely incremental fashion (that is what is meant by
  * on-line) estimates are available at any time and the amount of memory used is constant.  Somewhat
  * surprisingly, the quantile estimates are about as good as you would get if you actually kept all
  * of the samples.
  * <p/>
  * The method used for mean and variance is Welford's method.  See
  * <p/>
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#On-line_algorithm
  * <p/>
  * The method used for computing the quartiles is a simplified form of the stochastic approximation
  * method described in the article "Incremental Quantile Estimation for Massive Tracking" by Chen,
  * Lambert and Pinheiro
