 /**
   An <code>IndexWriter</code> creates and maintains an index.
 
   <p>The <code>create</code> argument to the 
   <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer, boolean)"><b>constructor</b></a>
   determines whether a new index is created, or whether an existing index is
   opened.  Note that you
   can open an index with <code>create=true</code> even while readers are
   using the index.  The old readers will continue to search
   the "point in time" snapshot they had opened, and won't
   see the newly created index until they re-open.  There are
   also <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
   with no <code>create</code> argument which
   will create a new index if there is not already an index at the
   provided path and otherwise open the existing index.</p>
 
   <p>In either case, documents are added with <a
   href="#addDocument(org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>addDocument</b></a>
   and removed with <a
   href="#deleteDocuments(org.apache.lucene.index.Term)"><b>deleteDocuments</b></a>.
   A document can be updated with <a href="#updateDocument(org.apache.lucene.index.Term, org.apache.lucene.document.Document)"><b>updateDocument</b></a> 
   (which just deletes and then adds the entire document).
   When finished adding, deleting and updating documents, <a href="#close()"><b>close</b></a> should be called.</p>
 
   <p>These changes are buffered in memory and periodically
   flushed to the {@link Directory} (during the above method
   calls).  A flush is triggered when there are enough
   buffered deletes (see {@link #setMaxBufferedDeleteTerms})
   or enough added documents since the last flush, whichever
   is sooner.  For the added documents, flushing is triggered
   either by RAM usage of the documents (see {@link
   #setRAMBufferSizeMB}) or the number of added documents
   (this is the default; see {@link #setMaxBufferedDocs}).
   For best indexing speed you should flush by RAM usage with
   a large RAM buffer.  You can also force a flush by calling
   {@link #flush}.  When a flush occurs, both pending deletes
   and added documents are flushed to the index.  A flush may
   also trigger one or more segment merges.</p>
 
   <a name="autoCommit"></a>
   <p>The optional <code>autoCommit</code> argument to the
   <a href="#IndexWriter(org.apache.lucene.store.Directory, boolean, org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer)"><b>constructors</b></a>
   controls visibility of the changes to {@link IndexReader} instances reading the same index.
   When this is <code>false</code>, changes are not
   visible until {@link #close()} is called.
   Note that changes will still be flushed to the
   {@link org.apache.lucene.store.Directory} as new files,
   but are not committed (no new <code>segments_N</code> file
   is written referencing the new files) until {@link #close} is
   called.  If something goes terribly wrong (for example the
   JVM crashes) before {@link #close()}, then
   the index will reflect none of the changes made (it will
   remain in its starting state).
   You can also call {@link #abort()}, which closes the writer without committing any
   changes, and removes any index
   files that had been flushed but are now unreferenced.
   This mode is useful for preventing readers from refreshing
   at a bad time (for example after you've done all your
   deletes but before you've done your adds).
   It can also be used to implement simple single-writer
   transactional semantics ("all or none").</p>
 
   <p>When <code>autoCommit</code> is <code>true</code> then
   every flush is also a commit ({@link IndexReader}
   instances will see each flush as changes to the index).
   This is the default, to match the behavior before 2.2.
   When running in this mode, be careful not to refresh your
   readers while optimize or segment merges are taking place
   as this can tie up substantial disk space.</p>
   
   <p>Regardless of <code>autoCommit</code>, an {@link
   IndexReader} or {@link org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher} will only see the
   index as of the "point in time" that it was opened.  Any
   changes committed to the index after the reader was opened
   are not visible until the reader is re-opened.</p>
 
   <p>If an index will not have more documents added for a while and optimal search
   performance is desired, then the <a href="#optimize()"><b>optimize</b></a>
   method should be called before the index is closed.</p>
 
   <p>Opening an <code>IndexWriter</code> creates a lock file for the directory in use. Trying to open
   another <code>IndexWriter</code> on the same directory will lead to a
   {@link LockObtainFailedException}. The {@link LockObtainFailedException}
   is also thrown if an IndexReader on the same directory is used to delete documents
   from the index.</p>
   
   <a name="deletionPolicy"></a>
   <p>Expert: <code>IndexWriter</code> allows an optional
   {@link IndexDeletionPolicy} implementation to be
   specified.  You can use this to control when prior commits
   are deleted from the index.  The default policy is {@link
   KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy} which removes all prior
   commits as soon as a new commit is done (this matches
   behavior before 2.2).  Creating your own policy can allow
   you to explicitly keep previous "point in time" commits
   alive in the index for some time, to allow readers to
   refresh to the new commit without having the old commit
   deleted out from under them.  This is necessary on
   filesystems like NFS that do not support "delete on last
   close" semantics, which Lucene's "point in time" search
   normally relies on. </p>

 /*
  * Clarification: Check Points (and commits)
  * Being able to set autoCommit=false allows IndexWriter to flush and 
  * write new index files to the directory without writing a new segments_N
  * file which references these new files. It also means that the state of 
  * the in memory SegmentInfos object is different than the most recent
  * segments_N file written to the directory.
  * 
  * Each time the SegmentInfos is changed, and matches the (possibly 
  * modified) directory files, we have a new "check point". 
  * If the modified/new SegmentInfos is written to disk - as a new 
  * (generation of) segments_N file - this check point is also an 
  * IndexCommitPoint.
  * 
  * With autoCommit=true, every checkPoint is also a CommitPoint.
  * With autoCommit=false, some checkPoints may not be commits.
  * 
  * A new checkpoint always replaces the previous checkpoint and 
  * becomes the new "front" of the index. This allows the IndexFileDeleter 
  * to delete files that are referenced only by stale checkpoints.
  * (files that were created since the last commit, but are no longer
  * referenced by the "front" of the index). For this, IndexFileDeleter 
  * keeps track of the last non commit checkpoint.

    *
    * <ul>
    * <li>
    * 
    * <p>If no readers/searchers are open against the index,
    * then free space required is up to 1X the total size of
    * the starting index.  For example, if the starting
    * index is 10 GB, then you must have up to 10 GB of free
    * space before calling optimize.</p>
    *
    * <li>
    * 
    * <p>If readers/searchers are using the index, then free
    * space required is up to 2X the size of the starting
    * index.  This is because in addition to the 1X used by
    * optimize, the original 1X of the starting index is
    * still consuming space in the Directory as the readers
    * are holding the segments files open.  Even on Unix,
    * where it will appear as if the files are gone ("ls"
    * won't list them), they still consume storage due to
    * "delete on last close" semantics.</p>
    * 
    * <p>Furthermore, if some but not all readers re-open
    * while the optimize is underway, this will cause > 2X
    * temporary space to be consumed as those new readers
    * will then hold open the partially optimized segments at
    * that time.  It is best not to re-open readers while
    * optimize is running.</p>
    *
    * </ul>
    *
    * <p>The actual temporary usage could be much less than
    * these figures (it depends on many factors).</p>
    *
    * <p>Once the optimize completes, the total size of the
    * index will be less than the size of the starting index.
    * It could be quite a bit smaller (if there were many
    * pending deletes) or just slightly smaller.</p>
    *
    * <p>If an Exception is hit during optimize(), for example
    * due to disk full, the index will not be corrupt and no
    * documents will have been lost.  However, it may have
    * been partially optimized (some segments were merged but
    * not all), and it's possible that one of the segments in
    * the index will be in non-compound format even when
